# QuantFrame

A comprehensive framework for quantitative financial research, backtesting, and live trading.

## Overview

QuantFrame is designed to provide a complete ecosystem for quantitative financial research and trading. It streamlines the process from data acquisition to strategy development and live deployment, with a focus on maintainability, reproducibility, and seamless transition between research and production.

## Features

- **Unified Data Management**: Centralized ETL processes, automated ingestion, and standardized access patterns
- **Robust Backtesting**: Multi-asset, multi-timeframe simulation with realistic market mechanics
- **Production-Ready Trading**: Seamless transition from research to live trading
- **Model Flexibility**: Support for statistical, factor-based, and machine learning approaches
- **Risk Management**: Integrated position sizing and risk controls

### Key Components

#### Data Layer

- Data connectors for market and alternative data sources
- Processing pipelines for cleaning and feature engineering
- Unified storage interfaces for efficient data access

#### Research Layer

- Backtesting engine with realistic market simulation
- Strategy development framework
- Performance analytics and visualization

#### Execution Layer

- Broker-agnostic trading interfaces
- Order management and execution algorithms
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

#### Common Layer

- Shared interfaces ensuring compatibility between research and production
- Configuration management
- Logging and error handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: Anaconda or Miniconda

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantframe.git
cd quantframe

# Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n quantframe python=3.9
conda activate quantframe

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

```python
from quantframe.data import DataManager
from quantframe.research import Backtest
from quantframe.models import ExampleStrategy

# Load and prepare data
dm = DataManager()
data = dm.get_data('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2021-01-01')

# Create and run a backtest
strategy = ExampleStrategy(params={'window': 20})
backtest = Backtest(data=data, strategy=strategy)
results = backtest.run()

# Analyze results
results.plot_performance()
print(results.metrics)

# Deploy to live trading
from quantframe.execution import TradingEngine
engine = TradingEngine(strategy=strategy, broker='example_broker')
engine.start()
```

## Extending the Framework

### Adding a New Data Source

Create a new connector in `data/connectors/` that implements the `DataSourceInterface`.

### Developing a Strategy

Implement the `StrategyInterface` in `research/models/` and use the backtesting engine to evaluate performance.

### Supporting a New Broker

Add a new broker implementation in `execution/brokers/` that conforms to the `BrokerInterface`.
