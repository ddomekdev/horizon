# AI Agent README - QuantFrame Project

## Project Context

This document provides essential context for AI assistants working on the QuantFrame project - a comprehensive quantitative financial research and trading framework. As an AI assistant, you should use this document to understand the project's goals, architecture, and implementation priorities.

## Project Vision

QuantFrame aims to create a unified ecosystem where quantitative financial models can be:

1. Researched and developed using historical data
2. Rigorously backtested with realistic market conditions
3. Seamlessly deployed to live trading with minimal code changes

The core philosophy is "write once, run anywhere" - any trading strategy or model should work identically in both research and production environments.

## Current State

We are in the initial architecture and implementation planning phase. The directory structure has been established as follows:

```
quantframe/
├── data/               # ETL, automated ingestion, market data management
├── research/           # Backtesting framework and model development
├── execution/          # Live trading implementation
├── common/             # Shared components used across all modules
├── tests/              # Testing infrastructure
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts
├── examples/           # Example implementations
└── infrastructure/     # Deployment configuration
```

## Key Challenges to Address

As an AI assistant, be prepared to help with the following technical challenges:

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensuring identical data processing between backtesting and live environments
2. **Market Simulation Accuracy**: Creating realistic backtests that account for slippage, fees, and market impact
3. **Model Portability**: Designing interfaces that allow models to run unchanged in both research and production
4. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing computational efficiency with accuracy in data-intensive operations
5. **Risk Management**: Implementing robust safeguards for live trading operations

## Technical Stack Considerations

- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, possibly Dask for larger datasets
- **Machine Learning**: Optional components using scikit-learn, PyTorch, or similar
- **Database**: Time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for market data
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, possibly Kubernetes for scaling

## Development Priorities

1. First priority: Core data infrastructure and interfaces
2. Second priority: Backtesting engine with basic strategy templates
3. Third priority: Paper trading simulation
4. Fourth priority: Live trading with broker connections
5. Fifth priority: Advanced analytics and reporting

## Design Principles to Follow

When suggesting implementations or solutions, adhere to these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components should be loosely coupled through well-defined interfaces
2. **Testability**: Code should be structured for easy unit and integration testing
3. **Configurability**: Major parameters should be configurable without code changes
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new data sources, models, or brokers
5. **Reproducibility**: Results should be reproducible with the same inputs

## Expected Interactions

As an AI assistant, you may be asked to:

1. Suggest implementation patterns for specific components
2. Write code examples for core functionality
3. Review proposed architectures or implementations
4. Help debug issues in data processing or algorithm logic
5. Recommend best practices for quantitative finance software
6. Assist with performance optimization

## Implementation Notes

- **Data Access Pattern**: All components should access data through the same interfaces
- **Model Interface**: Trading strategies need standard methods for initialization, receiving data, and generating signals
- **Configuration**: Use a consistent approach to configuration management across all components
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is crucial for debugging and performance analysis

## Next Steps

The immediate focus is on implementing the core data infrastructure and establishing the interfaces between components. This includes:

1. Defining abstract interfaces in the `common/interfaces/` directory
2. Implementing basic data connectors for common financial data sources
3. Creating the foundation of the backtesting engine
4. Setting up the project environment and dependencies

Your assistance in planning and implementing these components will be invaluable for creating a robust, maintainable quantitative research framework.
